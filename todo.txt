- even if group mode can't be changed due to participants in grouped sessions, mode should still be displayed (Ingmar)
- Label ungrouped session should not be displayed if there are now groups (Ingmar)
- once there are participants in some sessions of a group, the user should not be able to remove any session of that group (John)

    Restrict grouping
        views
            Ensure groups with participants don't have options to merge with other groups in actions. (John)
            Ensure groups without participants do not have the options to merge with groups that do. (John)
            Ensure groups with participants can't change mode. (John)


Later (Ingmar):
  Bigger boxes for filters in experiments / participants. (Ingmar)
  I18nize lines 108 and 109 in enrollment controller (Ingmar)
