min_session could be multiple
internationalisation

Chatter for next time:
John: Should we allow merging of a group if participants already exist? (Prob user specified)
John: If a session has participants should we prevent it being removed from a group? (Prob user specified)
John: I've placed default mode inside of Session_Group model, best place?

Need to automatically test 
    Restrict grouping
        views
            Ensure groups with participants don't have options to merge with other groups in actions.
            Ensure groups without participants do not have the options to merge with groups that do.
        controllers
            Ensure error is thrown on attempt to add two sessions together when one or more has participants
            Ensure error is thrown on attempt to add session with participants to group.

    Correct mode on new group
        views
            that modal buttons don't appear when no groups in session.
        controllers
            that the first created group in a session has the default mode.
            That clicking a modal button changes the status of all tests.
            That the second created group in a session has the mode of the first.
            (This seems largely sequential)

BUG:
Cannot enrol if one of the sessoins in group is full.
    User -> Avaiable Sessions

ENROL
    index
    confirm
    Recode presentation of enrol:
        index
        confirm
    
    random
        Session with least
        if more than one, random.

SESSION/PARTICIPANTS
    moving
    removing
        Removing participants doesn't work IF participant has enrolled (Not sure if this is known)

    if user moved to new group:
            randomised: pick session
            all: move to all sessions.
            all -> seperate; remove from all sessions into seperate session.
