    Restrict grouping

            Ensure groups with participants don't have options to merge with other groups in actions. (John)
            Ensure groups without participants do not have the options to merge with groups that do. (John)
            Ensure groups with participants can't change mode. (John)

Later (Ingmar):
  Bigger boxes for filters in experiments / participants. (Ingmar)
