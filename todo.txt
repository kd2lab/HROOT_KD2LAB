Need to automatically test

- even if group mode can't be changed due to participants in grouped sessions, mode should still be displayed (Ingmar)
- Label ungrouped session should not be displayed if there are now groups (Ingmar)

John: Thinking of using rspec (Possibly even rspec-given, that framework just looks so nice) with Capybara for view testing; not sure of appropriate place for this.
    Restrict grouping
        views
            Ensure groups with participants don't have options to merge with other groups in actions. (John)
            Ensure groups without participants do not have the options to merge with groups that do. (John)
            Ensure groups with participants can't change mode. (John)

Discuss:
John: Found issue with sessions. Previously they could be merged into groups that have participants. This is now fixed but thought I'd double check intended behaviour.

Later (Ingmar):
  Bigger boxes for filters in experiments / participants. (Ingmar)
  I18nize lines 108 and 109 in enrollment controller (Ingmar)
