CORRECT MODE ON NEW GROUP
New group -> handle mode
Correct mode on new group. (Based on the .first of current group_sessions).

John: Works when first session already exists, but not if it's the first session to be grouped.
Ingmar: Hide group buttons, use default modal value.

Chatter for next time:
John: Should we allow merging of a group if participants already exist? (Prob user specified)
John: If a session has participants should we prevent it being removed from a group? (Prob user specified)

Need to automatically test 
    Restrict grouping
        views
            Ensure groups with participants don't have options to merge with other groups in actions.
            Ensure groups without participants do not have the options to merge with groups that do.
        controllers
            Ensure error is thrown on attempt to add two sessions together when one or more has participants
            Ensure error is thrown on attempt to add session with participants to group.

John: Could go two ways, eliminate option or raise error once attempted.
Ingmar: Both ftw.

Notes: 
Testing: User -> Available sessions 

BUG:
Cannot enrolling if one of the sessoins in group is full.
    User -> Avaiable Sessions

SESSION/PARTICIPANTS
    moving
    removing
        Removing participants doesn't work (Not sure if this is known)

    if user moved to new group:
            randomised: pick session
            all: move to all sessions.
            all -> seperate; remove from all sessions into seperate session.
