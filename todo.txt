CORRECT MODE ON NEW GROUP
New group -> handle mode
Correct mode on new group. (Based on the .first of current group_sessions).

John: Works when first session already exists, but not if it's the first session to be grouped.
Ingmar: Hide group buttons, use default modal value.

RESTRICT GROUPING
Restrict grouping of sessions to those with 0 participants
    When merging two single sessions into group.

session_controller
Restrict grouping
    eliminate option
    raise error (controller -> create_group_with) if one user in one session. (is participations.invited_at)

Need to test 

John: Could go two ways, eliminate option or raise error once attempted.
Ingmar: Both ftw.

Notes: 
Testing: User -> Available sessions 

BUG:
Cannot enrolling if one of the sessoins in group is full.
    User -> Avaiable Sessions
